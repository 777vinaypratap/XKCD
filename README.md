# Steps for the project.

Firstly, I will create a index.php file, which will only contain html data for some user interface. 
( I use ".php" instead of ".html" format to give a better look for php project.)

Now, I will write javascript and css file to give functionality and styles to html body. (Basic Structure)
I have used Jquery for simplicity and faster code writing.
Use Ajax in Jquery to send post request to server, it gives functionality to run beforesend and aftersend function.
